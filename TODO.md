# TinyCRM Project TODO List

## High-Priority Caching Opportunities (Redis Integration)

- [ ] Implement Redis caching for Dashboard Statistics & Analytics (`/dashboard/stats` endpoint).
  - Cache dashboard stats per organization (TTL: 5-15 minutes).
  - Invalidate cache on data changes (contacts, deals, activities).
- [ ] Integrate Redis for User Authentication & Session Management.
  - Store refresh tokens in Redis with TTL.
  - Cache user permissions and organization memberships.
  - Implement blacklisting for revoked tokens.
  - Enable session management across multiple server instances.
- [ ] Cache Organization Context & Permissions in Redis.
  - Cache user-organization role mappings.
  - Cache organization metadata.
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for Search Results & Filtered Lists.
  - Cache search results with query parameters as key.
  - Cache filtered lists by organization and filters.
  - Implement search result pagination caching.

## Medium-Priority Caching Opportunities (Redis Integration)

- [ ] Store OAuth State Management tokens in Redis with short TTL.
- [ ] Store Email Verification & Password Reset Tokens in Redis with TTL.
- [ ] Cache Frequently Accessed Data (individual contact/deal/activity records, organization details, user profile information).
- [ ] **Implement API Rate Limiting using Redis.**
  - Use Redis's atomic `INCR` and `EXPIRE` commands for performant and safe rate limiting.
  - Protect API endpoints from abuse with configurable rate limits per endpoint/user.

## Advanced Caching Opportunities (Redis Integration)

- [ ] **Expand Redis Role for Real-time Features:**
  - **Real-time Notifications:** Utilize Redis's Pub/Sub feature to power real-time notifications via WebSockets.
  - When important events occur (e.g., new deal created), publish messages to Redis channels for connected clients.
  - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting using Redis's atomic `INCR` and `EXPIRE` commands for performant API protection.
- [ ] Cache Data Aggregation & Reporting results.
- [ ] Implement Multi-tenant Data Isolation with organization-specific cache keys.
- [ ] Implement API Response Caching for GET requests.

## Implementation Recommendations (Redis)

- [ ] Define and implement a consistent Cache Key Strategy.
- [ ] **Implement a Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
  - For every service function that modifies data (e.g., updating user roles, changing organization names), actively invalidate corresponding Redis cache keys.
  - Ensure cache doesn't serve stale data after write operations.
  - Follow the pattern: 1. Update the database. 2. Delete the relevant key from Redis.
  - Implement Write-through, TTL-based, Event-driven, and Organization-scoped invalidation strategies.
- [ ] Configure Redis for optimal performance (Memory, Persistence, Replication, Monitoring).
