- Logging and recovery patterns

### 🏢 [Multi-tenant Architecture](rules/multi-tenant-architecture.mdc)
- Organization and membership models
- Permission checking patterns
- Data isolation strategies
- Role-based access control

### 🧪 [Testing Patterns](rules/testing-patterns.mdc)
- Integration testing patterns
- Service and API testing
- Mock usage patterns
- Test fixtures and database setup

### 🏗️ [Backend Architecture](rules/backend-architecture.mdc) *(Always Applied)*
- Overall project structure
- Coding standards and conventions
- Configuration management
- Performance and security best practices

## How to Use These Rules

### Automatic Application
Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically applied to all requests and will influence the AI's responses and code generation.

### Manual Application
Rules with `description` fields can be manually applied by mentioning their description in your request, or by asking Cursor to apply a specific rule.

### File-Specific Rules
Rules with `globs` patterns are automatically applied when working with files matching those patterns.

## Key Patterns Covered

### FastAPI Best Practices
- Async route handlers for all I/O operations
- Pydantic models for input validation and responses
- Dependency injection for database, cache, and services
- Proper HTTP status codes and error responses

### Authentication & Security
- JWT access tokens (30-minute expiry)
- Redis-stored refresh tokens (30-day expiry)
- OAuth integration with multiple providers
- Session invalidation on security events

### Multi-tenant Architecture
- Organization-scoped data access
- Role-based permissions (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- Membership validation for all operations
- Cache key scoping by organization

### Database Patterns
- MongoDB with async Motor operations
- Pydantic models with ObjectId handling
- Aggregation pipelines for complex queries
- Proper error handling and connection management

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for high-performance caching
- Organization-scoped cache keys to prevent cross-tenant access
- Graceful fallback when Redis is unavailable
- Strategic cache invalidation patterns

### Error Handling
- Early return pattern for error conditions
- HTTP exceptions with appropriate status codes
- Comprehensive logging with context
- Recovery patterns and graceful degradation

## Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: Async web framework
- **MongoDB + Motor**: Async database operations
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Pydantic v2**: Data validation and serialization
- **JWT**: Authentication tokens
- **OAuth**: Social login integration

## Development Workflow

1. **Route Development**: Use FastAPI router patterns
2. **Business Logic**: Implement in service layer with proper error handling
3. **Data Access**: Follow database patterns with async operations
4. **Caching**: Implement strategic caching with organization scoping
5. **Security**: Apply authentication and authorization patterns
6. **Testing**: Use comprehensive testing patterns for validation

## Code Quality Standards

- Full type hints on all functions
- Descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Dependency injection for testability
- Clean separation of concerns

These rules ensure consistent, maintainable, and secure code across the entire backend codebase.
